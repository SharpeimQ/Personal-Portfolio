## **What is Virella?**  
Virella LLC is a protein powder company I co-founded with a business partner. Our mission is to develop a high-quality, delicious, and affordable protein formula that helps individuals meet their daily protein needs without breaking the bank. We’re committed to providing premium nutrition at an accessible price, ensuring that budget-conscious consumers never have to compromise on quality.


## **What we are Working on** 
My business partner and I are both undergraduates at NJIT currently balancing part-time jobs to generate revenue for our first line of product samples! We are also working on developing our company brand and product design.
