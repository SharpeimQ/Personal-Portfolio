### About Me
<div class="about-container">
  <div class="about-text">
    <p>
      Hello stranger! My name is Joseph Qiu Wang (王秋雨), a self-taught web developer and a Junior CS undergraduate at NJIT. Most of my foundational web-development knowledge came from The Odin Project, but I went rogue and just started making my own projects. I've also been spending way too much time polishing my technical interview skills...
    </p>
  </div>
      <p>
      Anyways, this website is pretty barebones! If you have any suggestions, please reach out to me and let me know. I am here to learn new skills, make fun projects, and land a job. If you want more of my “stats,” they’re pretty unimpressive haha—please don’t look... But if you must, you can access my resume below.
    </p>
