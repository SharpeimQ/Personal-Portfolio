# About Me
<div class="resume-post-container">
  <p>
    Hello stranger! My name is Joseph Q. Wang (王秋雨), a self-taught web developer and a Junior CS undergraduate at NJIT. I learned basic web development from The Odin Project in 2023, but burnt out and took a step back to focus on my academics and other interests.
  </p>
  <p>
    Now, after some time off and developing a solid routine (so very true), I decided to rekindle my web development journey in 2025. I mapped out a few fun projects I want to build based around some technologies I want to learn, including this portfolio website built with Jekyll (Jekflix template). I have some exciting plans, and so far, it's been nice getting back into it!
  </p>
  <p>
    I plan to learn by doing, and whenever I complete a project, I'll document it on this portfolio site.

# Reach out

  <p>
    Anyways, this website is pretty barebones! If you have any suggestions or want to work with me, feel free to reach out. You can do so by sending an email to <a href="mailto:SharpHaiyan@gmail.com">SharpHaiyan@gmail.com</a> or using the <a href="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/contact">Contact Form</a> on this website.
  </p>

  <p>
    I am here to learn new skills, work on or contribute to cool projects, and ultimately find a job that allows me the flexibility to do both. If you want more of my “stats,” you can access my resume below. I know my stats are still a bit a work in progress—but hey, I’m working on it!
